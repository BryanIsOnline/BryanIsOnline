Hello there, my name is Bryan (@BryanIsOnline)

I'm a PhD student at the University of Alberta specializing in mathematics. In particular, my field of study lies in the expansive area 
of algebra and representation theory. The essential idea of my research is to understand somewhat complicated algebraic structures (in my 
case, the ill-defined quantum groups) by reducing abstract algebra problems to linear algebra problems (this is the notation of a "representation").
