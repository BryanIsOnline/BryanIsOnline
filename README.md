Welome, my name is Bryan.

As a PhD candidate in mathematics at the University of Alberta ðŸ“–, my research lies in the expansive area of algebra and representation theory. The essential idea of my research is to reduce abstract mathematical problems to linear algebra problems, e.g., "representing" abstract elements as matrices.
