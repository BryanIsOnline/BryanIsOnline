Welome, my name is Bryan.

As a PhD candidate in mathematics at the University of Alberta ðŸ“–, my research lies in the expansive area of algebra and representation theory. The essential idea of my research is to understand somewhat complicated algebraic structures, e.g., quantum groups, by reducing abstract algebra problems to linear algebra problems, i.e., "representing" elements of these algebraic structures as linear maps on some vector space.
